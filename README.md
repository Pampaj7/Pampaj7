## 🏥 Previous Experience

### **AI Research Engineer @ CHOP — Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia**  
- Built **FaceBench**, a 3D reconstruction benchmark used in 10k+ mesh comparisons.  
- Achieved **10× pipeline speedup** and **100+ concurrent GPU evaluations**.  
- Designed an **identity-aware distance metric** improving accuracy by 30% over Chamfer/L2.  
- Benchmarked 8+ SOTA models for robustness, identity preservation, and runtime efficiency.

### **Computer Vision Engineer @ STLab — Software Technologies Lab**  
- Conducted **DeepGreen AI**, an energy-efficiency study across 6 languages and 3 DL frameworks.  
- Ran 60+ GPU experiments showing **4.6× energy** and **11× runtime variance** across implementations.  
- Identified configurations with minimal accuracy loss and major energy savings.  
- Co-authored paper under review on sustainable AI practices.

### **Founder & Technical Lead @ Sightcom**  
- Built chromosome detection system (95% accuracy on 10k+ images).  
- Deployed full-stack AI workflow (PyTorch → ONNX → Qt/C++) in 3 hospitals.  
- Reduced clinical analysis time from *5 minutes to 15 seconds*.  
- Developed and deployed 3 AI products with automated CI/CD pipelines.
